# Project Submission

This repository contains the submission for **Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python** from the Dicoding platform.

## Description

This project focuses on data analysis using Python, covering data preprocessing, visualization, and basic statistical analysis. The dataset used involves air quality measurements, and various Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are utilized to analyze the data effectively.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is installed (if using Jupyter):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, open Jupyter Notebook and execute the analysis scripts:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Inside the notebook, you will find:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and cleaning the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Summarizing key insights from the dataset.
